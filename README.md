# TADHack 2015 London

Project for TADHack 2015 in London (11./12. April 2015).

## Fixed-To-Mobile Number Mapper

This service maps a fixed number to a mobile number purely based on calling line identification. It is based on a self-developed API, Nexmo for handling SMS, and Restcomm for handling fixed line calls and their authentication logic.
